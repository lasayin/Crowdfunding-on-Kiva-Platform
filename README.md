# Springboard Data Science Career Track Capstone Project

* Analyzed and visualized the loans issued on the Kiva crowdfunding platform and got insights from the loans, borrowers, and lenders
* Predicted if a borrower can get crowdfunding quickly based on a customized threshold of funding speed to help the organization set investment priority
* Built classification models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, evaluated the performance of models and recommended optimal solution
